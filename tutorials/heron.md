## Heron's Formula

Heron's formula allows you to find the area of a triangle when you know the lengths of all three sides.
For a triangle with sides of length $a$, $b$, and $c$, the area $A$ is given by:

$s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}$

$A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$

### Example

Consider a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5.

$$
s = \frac{3 + 4 + 5}{2} = 6
$$

$$
A = \sqrt{6(6-3)(6-4)(6-5)} = \sqrt{6 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \sqrt{36} = 6
$$

The area of the triangle is 6.
