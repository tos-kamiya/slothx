### Tutorial: Installing a Standalone Script Using Slothx

This tutorial explains how to install a standalone script using **Slothx**.

The script `to_moodle_html.py` used in this example converts Markdown text to HTML for Moodle. Since the script is not packaged and depends on non-standard library packages, a virtual environment is required to run it.

### Running the Script Manually

This script depends on the `BeautifulSoup4` and `markdown` packages. To run it manually, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```sh
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ venv/bin/pip install beautifulsoup4 markdown
Collecting beautifulsoup4
  Using cached beautifulsoup4-4.12.3-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (3.8 kB)
Collecting markdown
  Using cached Markdown-3.7-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (7.0 kB)
...
```

2. Run the script within the virtual environment:

```sh
$ venv/bin/python to_moodle_html.py heron.md > heron.html
$ cat heron.html
<h2>
 Heron's Formula
</h2>
<p>
 Heron's formula allows you to find the area of a triangle when you know the lengths of all three sides.
...
```

### Installing and Running the Script with Slothx

The script can be easily installed using **Slothx**.

```sh
$ python3 slothx.py install to_moodle_html.py
  installed package to-moodle-html 0.1.0, installed using Python 3.12.3
  These apps are now globally available:
    - to-moodle-html
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨
Warning: 'pipx pin' is not supported in your version of pipx. Skipping pinning.
```

**NOTE**: The message `'Warning: 'pipx pin' is not supported in your version of pipx'` can be ignored. It simply means that you are using a version of `pipx` earlier than 1.6, which does not support the `pin` feature.

After installation, you can use the command `to-moodle-html` (derived from the script filename `to_moodle_html.py` by replacing underscores with hyphens) to convert Markdown to HTML, just like with the original script.

```sh
$ to-moodle-html heron.md > heron.html
$ cat heron.html
<h2>
 Heron's Formula
</h2>
<p>
 Heron's formula allows you to find the area of a triangle when you know the lengths of all three sides.
...
```

### Uninstalling the Script

To uninstall the command, use `pipx`:

```sh
$ pipx uninstall to-moodle-html
uninstalled to-moodle-html! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨
```
